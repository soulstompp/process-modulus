-- ⛔⛔⛔ `pm.layer` DIRECTLY, AND NOT `layers/every_layer.sqlc`, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS

--    the layer DIMENSION, reserved for denominators, and composing it here dragged the entire
--    dimension into the transitive closure of two thirds of the checker. Measured: 20 of 29 rules
--    reached `every_layer` through this one edge, and 1 does without it. ⛔ Any reach-containment
--    law over a rule is vacuous the moment the dimension is inside its closure, because the
--    dimension reaches everything by construction. `layers/every_layer.sqlc`'s own header now
--    carries the rule and `algebra/dimension_use.sqlc` enforces it over the compose DAG.

-- ⛔⛔ `seq = 1` WOULD BE A GUESS THAT COULD NOT ANNOUNCE ITSELF. A filing may
--   declare more than one regime, which is the whole reason `regime` is tall, and taking the
--   first silently picks one of them. Probed by giving the composition a second declaration: the
--   crossing count did not move, which is the danger rather than the reassurance. `states`
--   counts them, and a composition reporting under two frameworks makes "the framework it
--   composes INTO" a question with two answers, so the crossing is not KNOWN rather than absent.
